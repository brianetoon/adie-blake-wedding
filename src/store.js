            "We are just getting started! We met in 2018, as friends and co-workers, but that eventually blossomed into much more. In the years that followed, we worked together, we skied, cycled, golfed, and hiked together, and we shared many a belly laugh.",
            "Blake knew that Adrienne was The One early on because she's willing to ski moguls, is selfless, and puts as much energy into her career as he does. Adrienne fell for Blake because he is adventurous, energetic, and genuinely dedicated to anything he sets his mind to. Blake made her laugh (a lot), challenged her to ski rougher terrain, and even made delicious avocado toast and fluffy pancakes.",
            "The pandemic was a big test for our relationship, and we came out of it committed to spending the rest of our lives together. The avocado toast and pancakes helped."

            "We had an intimate wedding in the beach town of Mazunte in Oaxaca, Mexico. It was just us, our parents, our siblings and the sand, sun and water. It was incredibly relaxing, and so beautiful. The day of our wedding was magical. We laughed, we cried (just a little), and we ate some of the best food any of us have ever had. Don't worry, we took LOTS of pictures. Scroll through the photos to see some of our favorites",
