            "We are just getting started! We met in 2018, just as friends and co-workers, but that eventually blossomed into much more. In the years that followed, we worked together, we skied, cycled, golfed, and hiked together, and we shared many a belly laugh.",
            "Blake knew that Adrienne was The One early on because she’s willing to ski moguls, is selfless, and puts as much energy into her career as he does. Adrienne fell for Blake because he is adventurous, energetic, and genuinely dedicated to anything he sets his mind to. Blake made her laugh (a lot), challenged her to ski tougher terrain, and even made delicious avocado toast and fluffy pancakes.",
            "The pandemic was a huge and immediate test for our relationship, and we came out of it committed to spending the rest of our lives together. The avocado toast and pancakes helped."

            "We had an intimate wedding in the beach town of Mazunte in Oaxaca, Mexico. It was just us, our parents, our siblings, and the sand, sun, and water. It was incredibly relaxing and so beautiful. The day of our wedding was magical, and it was just the eight of us. We laughed, we cried (just a little), and we ate some of the best food any of us had ever had. Don’t worry, we took LOTS of pictures.",
